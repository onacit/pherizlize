Pherialize is a small library allowing serializing Java objects into the
PHP serializing format and unserializing data from 
this format back into Java objects.
  
So with Pherialize you can serialize PHP objects and unserialize them into
Java objects and vice versa. With a similiar implementation in JavaScript
you can also use Pherialize to transfer data between Java and JavaScript if
you like.
  
Up to now Pherialize can serialize the following Java data types:
  
* null
* Boolean
* String
* Char
* Byte
* Integer
* Short
* Long
* Float
* Double
* BigDecimal
* List
* Map
* Arrays
* Serializable (Through Reflection API)
* Mixed 
* Enums (Value used as string)
  
The Unserializer supports the following PHP data types:
  
* null
* boolean
* string
* int
* double
* array
  
References are supported, too. This allows you to serialize and unserialize
even complex types with circular references in it.

About this repository
---------------------

As the [original project](https://github.com/kayahr/pherialize) hasn't been updated in a number of years, and there are various
patches scattered amongst the forks, I've collected the patches that I think are important, and published it in Maven Central
to make it easier to use.

Usage
-----

### How to serialize data

For serializing a Java object into a PHP serialization format string you
just use the static method Pherialize.serialize(). Just pass the object you
want to serialize to this method and you get a string in return which you
can then unserialize in PHP.
  
Example:
  
    List list;

    list = new ArrayList();
    list.add("A string");
    list.add(Integer.valueOf(12345));
    list.add(Boolean.TRUE);
    System.out.println(Pherialize.serialize(list));

The result is printed to stdout and looks like this:
  
    a:3:{i:0;s:8:"A string";i:1;i:12345;i:2;b:1;}

Now you can use this string in PHP to unserialize it back into a PHP array:
  
    $data = unserialize('a:3:{i:0;s:8:"A string";i:1;i:12345;i:2;b:1;}');
    var_dump($data);

Result is a PHP array with exactly the data and types you have added to the
array with Java:

    array(3) {
      [0]=>
      string(8) "A string"
      [1]=>
      int(12345)
      [2]=>
      bool(true)
    }

### How to unserialize data

Let's assume you have serialized the PHP array from the previous example and
you have stored this serialized string in the variable _data_. For unserializing and
printing the value you just have to use the Pherialize.unserialize() method.

Example:
  
    MixedArray list;

    list = Pherialize.unserialize(data).toArray();
    System.out.println("Item 1: " + list.getString(0));
    System.out.println("Item 2: " + list.getInteger(1));
    System.out.println("Item 3: " + list.getBoolean(2));

The correct result printed to stdout is this:
  
    Item 1: A string
    Item 2: 12345
    Item 3: true


Types
-----

Because the data types in PHP are different to the types in Java conversion
is not always possible without switching to a different data type. If for
example you serialize a Java _Byte_ then you will get a PHP _int_ because PHP
does only knows the number types _int_ and _double_. So when you unserialize this
_int_ back into Java then you will end up with an _Integer_ and not with a _Byte_.
The same problem comes up with _Long_ objects. Pherialize serializes a _Long_
into a _int_ if it fits an _Integer_. Otherwise it's serialized into a _double_
  
To make life easier while unserializing PHP data into Java all PHP data
types are wrapped by an object of type _Mixed_. 
From this object you can 
convert the data easily in whatever you need (as long as the conversion makes
sense). 
 
Here is a complete list of the conversions performed when serializing Java
data types and unserializing them in PHP:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Java class</th>
    <th>PHP type</th>  
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>null</td>
    <td>null</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Boolean</td>
    <td>boolean</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Character</td>
    <td>string</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Byte</td>
    <td>int</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Short</td>
    <td>int</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Integer</td>
    <td>int</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Long</td>
    <td>int or double (Depending on how large the value is)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Float</td>
    <td>double</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Double</td>
    <td>double</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>string</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Collection</td>
    <td>array</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Map</td>
    <td>array</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Serializable</td>
    <td>object</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Enum</td>
    <td>Value used as a string</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mixed</td>
    <td>Depends on the raw type in the Mixed wrapper</td>
  </tr>
</table>

And here is a list of performed conversion when you unserialize PHP
data in Java. But note that you will never get in touch with these
conversions because it's completely hidden by the <Mixed wrapper>.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>PHP type</th>
    <th>Java class</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>null</td>
    <td>null</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>Boolean</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>int</td>
    <td>Integer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>double</td>
    <td>Double</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>String</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>array</td>
    <td>Map</td>
  </tr>
</table>
